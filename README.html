    <h1>Installation for Windows: (as part of <a style="color:gray" href="https://github.com/lthomp079/calculator-thing" target="_blank";>this repository</a> on github)</h1>
    <h2 style="color:tomato">Please report any issues on the main repository!!!</h2>
    <h3>Windows with g++</h3>
    <p>Run the 'ihavegcc.bat' file from the windows folder in the extracted main folder. <br>
         A file named 'calc.exe' will appear in the src folder. Your compiled calculator is there! Move it as you wish!</p>
    <h3>Windows with Python</h3>
    <p>Run the 'ihavepython.bat' file from the windows folder in the extracted main folder. <br>
        It will run directly for you, but you can't move this file. It is the only ay to run other than downloading the binary or having g++.</p>
    <h1>Installation for Linux:</h1>
    <h3>Linux with g++</h3>
    <p>In the extracted folder, in linux, open your terminal there. <br>
        Type <code>bash ihavelinuxgcc.sh</code>, then press enter. There will be a binary file in the src folder.<br>
        To run it again, open up the terminal in whatever folder you put the binary file (named calc) in, and type <code>./calc</code></p>
    <h3>Installation for linux without g++</h3>
    <p>In the extracted folder, go to linux, then open the terminal there. <br>
        In the terminal, type <code>bash ihavelinux.sh</code>. It will run the calc.</p>
    <p style="color:tomato;">You cannot move this file, unless you cange the cd in the file to go to whatever directory you have the .py file in.</p>
